The non availability of sanitary facilities impacts women and they suffer in silence.  Absence of sanitary facilities is primarily due to both poverty and cultural inhibitions, which had to be overcome.  Therefore, it was of paramount importance to ensure privacy and safety to women besides improving general hygiene and health to the rural people.
               The Government in 2001 decided to build Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women in all the 12,618 Village Panchayats in the State, at an approximate area of 750 sq.ft. each. The selected sites were easily accessible to the rural women and nearer to the habitations.  Each complex had 14 water closets, 2 bathrooms, 1 pump room with pump set, 1 water tub and stone-paved washing facilities.  Adequate water supply for washing and bathing requirements were also ensured.  The total users were identified and grouped for the purpose of allocation of individual toilets within the complex.  The Village Panchayats provided electricity connection for water supply and lighting and the allotted families maintained the upkeep of the complex.  The complexes were provided with incinerators for disposal of the sanitary napkins of the user women.
               Initially, 385 Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women were constructed at the rate of 1 per Panchayat Union at a cost of
               Rs.2.00 lakh each.  Between 2001 and 2004, all the Village Panchayats in the State were covered under the Scheme with the enhanced unit cost of Rs. 2.25 lakh.  However, most of the Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women were rendered unusable since the previous Government did not give adequate attention for its maintenance.
               As per the directions of the Hon’ble Chief Minister, 12,796 sanitary complexes which were in the state of disuse have been renovated at a cost of Rs.170 crore during 2011-12, thereby restoring the basic facilities of the rural women.`,

Similar to the facilities created for the rural women folk and based on the demand  raised by rural men for such facilities, the Hon’ble  Chief Minister has ordered the provision of  Integrated Men Sanitary  Complexes (IMSC), initially,  at the rate of two Complexes per Block during 2012-13.  In Tamil Nadu, 770 Integrated Men Sanitary Complexes have been taken up for construction in 385 Blocks at a cost of Rs.35 crore during 2012-13.
        
                   The District Collectors have identified the sites for construction of IMSCs taking into account the various parameters and local requirements like  prevalence of open defecation, predominance  of houses without toilets, availability of water supply, etc.  The total area of the Complex is 570 sq.ft.  Each complex has 8 toilets in which one toilet is provided with western closet for the benefit of the aged/differently abled and one is a baby friendly toilet.  Separate area for bathing, water tub and stone-paved washing facilities are also provided. Exclusive water supply is ensured in each Complex for sustainability and usage.  User Groups are formed and are involved from the construction stage itself. Similar to the maintenance of Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women, these User Groups will take up the day to day maintenance and periodical maintenance will be done by the Village Panchayats concerned.   Corporate bodies and NGOs will also be encouraged to take part in the maintenance of these complexes along with the User Groups.`,
