        title: `1.Tamil Nadu Village Habitations Improvement (THAI) Scheme`,
        desc: `This Government has introduced the flagship programme called Tamil Nadu Village Habitations Improvement (THAI) Scheme from 2011-12 onwards to overcome the bottlenecks in the uneven distribution of resources and to provide minimum basic infrastructure facilities to all the habitations. Tamil Nadu is the only State focusing on ‘Habitation’ as the unit of development and no other State in the Country is implementing such an innovative scheme.

            There are about 6 habitations on an average for each Village Panchayat in Tamil Nadu with 79,394 habitations in 12,524 Village Panchayats. However, the number of habitations varies from District to district. The average number of habitations in a Village Panchayat in The Nilgiris District is 37 whereas it is only 3 in Villupuram District. Therefore, allocation of equal amount to all the Village Panchayats, with varied number of habitations, has led to disparity in development, disproportionate distribution of assets and uneven progress. The THAI scheme has come as boon with the aim of extending the basic facilities to the grass root habitation.
        
            There are 12,524 Village Panchayats in the State spread across the 31 Districts (except Chennai). As can be seen from the following table, the population of Village Panchayats in Tamil Nadu varies widely with some Village Panchayats having population even below 500 while some others have population exceeding 10,000.
            
            Minimum Basic Requirements

            1 Water Supply
                    Drinking water supply works like provision of power pump, extension of pipeline, augmentation of existing source shall be taken up depending upon the requirement.

            2 Street Lights
                    New streetlights will be provided in the new habitations, extension areas, Adi-Dravidar & Tribal habitations and IAY housing colonies, based on the actual needs. Additional street lights, including solar powered lights will be provided in the areas where the existing coverage is felt inadequate.

            3  Cement Concrete Roads
                    Pavements with residential units on sides, streets or lanes prone to water logging, part of the uncovered portion where a portion of the street has already been covered with cement concrete, will be taken up on priority.
            4 Link Roads
                    Link roads will cover bus-plying roads, upgradation of WBM roads to BT roads connecting two or more habitations in the same Panchayat and upgradation of earthen/gravel roads.

            5  Cremation / Burial Grounds
                    Each burial ground / cremation ground will be provided with approach road, compound wall, cremation shed, water facility and lights.
            6  Pathway to Burial Ground
                    Wherever the pathway is already available, improvement of the existing pathway will be taken up and wherever pathway is not available, top priority will be given to provide approach road or pathway.
                    The additional requirements and other permitted works will be taken up based on the need and necessity. Apart from THAI, the scheme will be implemented by dovetailing funds, from various schemes of Rural Development & Panchayat Raj Department and schemes of other Departments.

            7 Scheme Implementation

                    The Scheme was implemented in 5 phases from 2011-12 to 2015-16.
                    During 2011-12, a total of 25,335 habitations in 2,020 Village Panchayats were selected for implementation with an annual allocation of Rs. 680 crore.
                    During 2012-13, this programme was implemented in 18,581 habitations of 2,250 Village Panchayats with an annual allocation of Rs.750 crore.`,

        title:`2.Chief Minister Solar Powered Green House Scheme (CMSPGHS)`,
        desc: `In the Governor’s address on 03.06.2011 in the Legislative Assembly, it was announced that “This Government will launch a ‘Solar Powered Green House Scheme’ for the benefit of the poor in the rural areas and construct houses measuring about 300 square feet at a unit cost of Rs.1.80 lakh by meeting the entire cost by the State  Government”. 

        Accordingly, this Government had ordered for construction of 60,000 Solar Powered Green Houses of 300 square feet each, every year for the next five years commencing from 2011-12 at a unit cost of Rs.1.80 lakhs per house.  The scheme is named as “Chief Minister’s Solar Powered Green House Scheme (CMSPGHS).”
        
        Construction of houses under “Chief Minister’s Solar Powered Green House Scheme” ordered by the Honourable Chief Minister is another milestone in the history of rural housing which clearly addresses the  shelter needs in rural areas. Nowhere in the country is such a free housing scheme for the construction of houses with an area of 300 sq.ft with solar powered lighting implemented.
        
        1 Salient features of the Scheme
        
            All the people living below poverty line in rural areas are eligible for Solar Powered Green Houses.
            Each house is built with an area of 300 square feet at a unit cost of Rs.1.80 lakh fully funded by the State Government.
            Each house consists of a living room, bed room, kitchen, toilet and verandah apart from Rain Water Harvesting provision.
            Each house is provided with 5 solar powered Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL), one each in bed room, living room, kitchen, toilet and verandah.  Each beneficiary is given the option to have an electric connection powered by TNEB, which will be metered.
            The unit cost is Rs.1.80 lakh per house @Rs.1.50 lakh for construction and Rs.30,000/- for Solar Powered Lights.
            The RD & PR Department is entrusted with the construction of houses and Tamil Nadu Energy Development Agency (TEDA) is the implementing agency for solar lighting component.
            The Green Houses are constructed either insitu (replacing his/her existing dwelling structure) or in the land owned by the beneficiary elsewhere in the Village Panchayat.  No land acquisition is envisaged under this scheme.  Only people with patta for their sites are eligible under this scheme.
            The supply, installation and commissioning of solar panels and lights are undertaken directly by TEDA by following established procedures in      co-ordination with the Project Directors of District Rural Development Agencies.
                
        2 Quality Control & Inspection
                  TEDA will engage Project Management Consultants (PMC) and a third party inspection agency, whose responsibility is to ensure that all the materials used and the workmanship practiced conform to the prescribed specifications.  The inspection will cover quality checks of major materials at pre-shipment stage at the vendor’s outlet.
                  The PMC will ensure that 100% of the lights are installed after inspection.  Any defect in the SPV Home Lighting System will be brought to the notice of TEDA by the beneficiary/ Panchayat/ Block/ District Administration for immediate rectification.
                  In case the quality check reveals that the work is not satisfactory, the implementing agency (TEDA) shall ensure replacement of  the material or rectification of the defective workmanship, as the case may be, within the stipulated time.  All works rated unsatisfactory shall be re-inspected after the rectification report is received from the contractor.  Funds will be released to the commissioning agencies only after receiving satisfactory inspection reports. TEDA will designate an appropriate senior officer as incharge of the Monitoring system.
        
        3 Eligibility of the Beneficiaries

The non availability of sanitary facilities impacts women and they suffer in silence.  Absence of sanitary facilities is primarily due to both poverty and cultural inhibitions, which had to be overcome.  Therefore, it was of paramount importance to ensure privacy and safety to women besides improving general hygiene and health to the rural people.
               The Government in 2001 decided to build Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women in all the 12,618 Village Panchayats in the State, at an approximate area of 750 sq.ft. each. The selected sites were easily accessible to the rural women and nearer to the habitations.  Each complex had 14 water closets, 2 bathrooms, 1 pump room with pump set, 1 water tub and stone-paved washing facilities.  Adequate water supply for washing and bathing requirements were also ensured.  The total users were identified and grouped for the purpose of allocation of individual toilets within the complex.  The Village Panchayats provided electricity connection for water supply and lighting and the allotted families maintained the upkeep of the complex.  The complexes were provided with incinerators for disposal of the sanitary napkins of the user women.
               Initially, 385 Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women were constructed at the rate of 1 per Panchayat Union at a cost of
               Rs.2.00 lakh each.  Between 2001 and 2004, all the Village Panchayats in the State were covered under the Scheme with the enhanced unit cost of Rs. 2.25 lakh.  However, most of the Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women were rendered unusable since the previous Government did not give adequate attention for its maintenance.
               As per the directions of the Hon’ble Chief Minister, 12,796 sanitary complexes which were in the state of disuse have been renovated at a cost of Rs.170 crore during 2011-12, thereby restoring the basic facilities of the rural women.`,

Similar to the maintenance of Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women, these User Groups will take up the day to day maintenance and periodical maintenance will be done by the Village Panchayats concerned.   Corporate bodies and NGOs will also be encouraged to take part in the maintenance of these complexes along with the User Groups.`,
